# Principia (ML) Mathematica

> Behold the mighty *Principia (ML) Mathematica* — an honest attempt to understand the mathematics that powers deep learning.

For the longest time, I found equations intimidating. Something to get through, not something to actually understand. I used them when I had to, often relying on code or intuition to skip past the hard parts. But the deeper I go into machine learning, the more I realize: real understanding begins where the math starts. This repo is my way of slowing down, showing up, and giving these concepts the respect they deserve.

Inspired by the book *Math for Deep Learning*, this space documents my journey through the foundations. From linear algebra and calculus to probability and optimization, with the goal of building true confidence, not just passing familiarity.

If you're not afraid of a few matrices, gradients, or integrals, and if you believe that true confidence comes from clarity, not just code, then you’re welcome here.
